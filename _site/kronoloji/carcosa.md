Beneath a sickly, star-choked sky, Carcosa looms—a city that is no city, sprawling in labyrinthine tangles of alabaster towers and obsidian spires that defy the laws of man and gods alike. The air smells of rot and roses, and every shadow flickers as though alive. Here, time falters, stumbling forward one moment and sliding backward the next, an eternal danse macabre beneath the black stars that gaze down like pitiless, lidless eyes.

This is no mortal realm; this is Carcosa Inferna, a hell born of madness and ambition, where the labyrinthine city intertwines with the Nine Infernal Dominions, each a layer more terrible than the last. To enter is to lose yourself, piece by piece, until even the memory of your name becomes a ghost.

### The First Dominion: _The Crimson Court_

At the edge of Carcosa, the Crimson Court stretches endless, its marble halls stained red as if the stones themselves weep. This is the realm of Vanity, where souls clad in tattered finery dance forever to music that sounds of weeping. The King in Yellow presides, a figure of shifting shadows, his voice soft as silk and sharp as razors. Those who gaze upon his shrouded form are cursed to see their own faces in his mask.

---

### The Second Dominion: _The Mire of Chains_

A realm of fetid swamps and endless bogs, where iron trees grow heavy with the chains of the damned. The air is thick with the acrid stench of rust and despair. The waters churn with creatures too monstrous to name, their cries a symphony of suffering. Here, ambition is bound and dragged into the depths, weighed down by the dreams that once soared too high.

---

### The Third Dominion: _The Labyrinth of Echoes_

An endless maze of mirrored walls and shifting corridors, where no path is the same twice. Whispers of forgotten truths and unspeakable lies swirl in the air, seeping into the ears of the unwary. Those who venture here are forced to confront reflections of their own sins, twisted into grotesque parodies. It is said that the way out lies at the center, but no soul has ever reached it.

---

### The Fourth Dominion: _The Feast Eternal_

A banquet hall as vast as the horizon, its long tables laden with rotting food and wine that smells of blood. Gluttonous demons sit at the tables, their bodies bloated and grotesque, feeding endlessly on dishes that reform even as they rot. The wails of the damned echo through the hall, for they too are forced to feast, their hunger never sated, their throats forever parched.

---

### The Fifth Dominion: _The Chasm of Whispers_

A gaping abyss, its depths unseen, from which a constant murmur rises—a chorus of secrets that should never have been spoken. Those who listen too long find their own voices stolen, their words becoming part of the ever-growing cacophony. The ground here is brittle, cracking underfoot, and one misstep sends the unwary plunging into the endless void.

---

### The Sixth Dominion: _The Black Forge_

A city within a city, its towers belching black smoke that blots out the stars. Here, the fires of ambition burn hottest, consuming all who dare to create. Artisans toil endlessly, forging weapons and artifacts that will bring only ruin. The clang of hammers echoes through the air, mingling with the screams of those who have become one with the molten metal.

---

### The Seventh Dominion: _The Garden of False Dawn_

A place of deceptive beauty, where golden light filters through trees heavy with forbidden fruit. The air is sweet with the scent of flowers, yet every petal conceals a poison, every fruit a curse. Those who wander here are lulled into dreams of what might have been, their bodies rooted to the earth as they are consumed by the very beauty they sought to possess.

---

### The Eighth Dominion: _The Silent Sea_

An endless ocean of black water, its surface as still as glass. Ships crewed by skeletal mariners drift aimlessly, their tattered sails whispering of despair. The waters are cold and hungry, swallowing all who dare to touch them. At its heart lies an island of jagged stone, where a great throne sits empty, waiting for a ruler who will never come.

---

### The Ninth Dominion: _The Throne of Madness_

At the heart of Carcosa, atop a mountain of jagged bone, sits the Throne of Madness, where the King in Yellow waits. The air here is heavy with the weight of a thousand lifetimes, and the stars burn brighter and crueler than anywhere else. The throne itself is a thing of shifting forms, its edges flickering like fire, its surface alive with the faces of those who have dared to sit upon it. To ascend the throne is to be unmade, piece by piece, until nothing remains but a name whispered in the dark.

---

Here, in this union of Carcosa and Hell, the boundaries between the real and unreal dissolve. It is a place where despair reigns eternal, and hope is but a fleeting mirage—a place that exists not in space, but in the darkest corners of the soul.
